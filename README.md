# logo_maker
With this application one can very simply create their own logo using an svg file. The cool thing about svg files is that they dont lose resolution when you zoom into them which is why theyre very popular. For this applicatio I used the node modules jest and inquirer, inquirer was used to prompt the user with questions on how theyd like their logo to be designed. Offering a few options ilke how many characters for the logo, what color for the text of the logo, the type of shape which could be square, circle, or orange. And finally the color of the specific shape. By previewing the svg file you're able to see how the logo would look like and one can even download it.  Below I have linked a walk through video on what I would do in the terminal to get the desired result.
